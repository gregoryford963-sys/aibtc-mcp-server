## Quick Start

### One-Command Install

```bash
npx @aibtc/mcp-server@latest --install
```

That's it! This automatically configures Claude Code. Restart your terminal and start chatting.

**For testnet:**
```bash
npx @aibtc/mcp-server@latest --install --testnet
```

> **Why npx?** Using `npx @aibtc/mcp-server@latest` ensures you always get the newest version automatically. Global installs (`npm install -g`) won't auto-update.

## Giving Claude a Wallet

When you first use @aibtc/mcp-server, Claude doesn't have a wallet. Here's the smooth onboarding flow:

### Example Conversation

```
You: What's your wallet address?

Claude: I don't have a wallet yet. Would you like to assign me one?
        I can either create a fresh wallet or you can import an existing one.

You: Create a new wallet called "agent-wallet"

Claude: What password should I use to protect the wallet?

You: use "secure123password"

Claude: I now have a wallet! My address is ST1ABC...XYZ

        IMPORTANT: Please save this recovery phrase securely:
        "word1 word2 word3 ... word24"

        This phrase will NOT be shown again. It's the only way to recover
        the wallet if the password is forgotten.

You: Send 10 STX to ST2DEF...

Claude: Done! I've sent 10 STX to ST2DEF...
        Transaction: 0x123...
```

### Wallet States

| State | What Claude Says | What To Do |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| No wallet | "I don't have a wallet yet" | Use `wallet_create` or `wallet_import` |
| Locked | "My wallet is locked" | Use `wallet_unlock` with password |
| Ready | "My address is ST..." | Claude can perform transactions |

### Session Management

- By default, the wallet auto-locks after 15 minutes
- You can change this with `wallet_set_timeout` (set to 0 to disable)
- Use `wallet_lock` to manually lock the wallet
- Use `wallet_unlock` when you need Claude to transact again

## Wallet Storage

Claude's wallets are stored locally on your machine:

```
~/.aibtc/
├── wallets.json       # Wallet index (names, addresses - no secrets)
├── config.json        # Active wallet, settings
└── wallets/
    └── [wallet-id]/
        └── keystore.json  # Encrypted mnemonic (AES-256-GCM + Scrypt)
```

**Security:**
- AES-256-GCM encryption with Scrypt key derivation
- Password required to unlock
- Mnemonics never stored in plaintext
- File permissions set to owner-only (0600)

## Bitcoin L1 Support

Each wallet automatically derives both a **Stacks address** and a **Bitcoin address** from the same mnemonic using BIP39/BIP32 standards.

**Derivation Paths (BIP84):**
- Mainnet: `m/84'/0'/0'/0/0` (Bitcoin coin type 0)
- Testnet: `m/84'/1'/0'/0/0` (Bitcoin testnet coin type 1)

**Address Format:**
- Mainnet: `bc1q...` (Native SegWit P2WPKH)
- Testnet: `tb1q...` (Native SegWit P2WPKH)

**Capabilities:**
- Full Bitcoin L1 transaction support (send BTC)
- Balance and UTXO queries via mempool.space API
- Fee estimation (fast/medium/slow)
- P2WPKH (native SegWit) transactions for optimal fees

**Example:**
```
You: Create a wallet called "my-wallet"
Claude: I've created a wallet with:
        Stacks address: ST1ABC...
        Bitcoin address: bc1q...

You: Send 50000 sats to bc1q...
Claude: Done! Transaction broadcast: abc123...
```

Both addresses are derived from the same recovery phrase, making it easy to manage both Layer 1 (Bitcoin) and Layer 2 (Stacks) assets.

Or use any SIP-010 token by contract ID: `SP2X...::token-name`

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| `NETWORK` | `mainnet` or `testnet` | `mainnet` |
| `API_URL` | Default x402 API base URL | `https://x402.biwas.xyz` |
| `CLIENT_MNEMONIC` | (Optional) Pre-configured mnemonic | - |

**Note:** `CLIENT_MNEMONIC` is optional. The recommended approach is to let Claude create its own wallet.

## Architecture

```
You ←→ Claude ←→ aibtc-mcp-server
                        ↓
              Claude's Wallet (~/.aibtc/)
                        ↓
              ┌─────────┴─────────┐
              ↓                   ↓
        Hiro Stacks API    x402 Endpoints
              ↓                   ↓
        Stacks Blockchain  Paid API Services
```

## Security Notes

- Claude's wallet is stored encrypted on YOUR machine
- Password is never stored - only the encrypted keystore
- Mnemonics shown only once at creation
- Auto-lock after 15 minutes (configurable)
- Transactions signed locally before broadcast
- For mainnet: Fund with small amounts first

## Advanced: Pre-configured Mnemonic

For automated setups where Claude needs immediate wallet access, set the `CLIENT_MNEMONIC` environment variable in your `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aibtc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@aibtc/mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT_MNEMONIC": "your twenty four word mnemonic phrase",
        "NETWORK": "testnet"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This bypasses the wallet creation flow - Claude has immediate access to transact.
